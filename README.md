# Introduction 

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

[Apolloâ€™s Rover CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover) uses this repository to initialize a [graph](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/concepts/graphs). Running Rover's [`init`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/init) command provides a structured setup for managing and orchestrating APIs efficiently.

# Prerequisites

## Install the Rover CLI
Rover is the primary command-line interface for GraphOSâ€”a necessary tool to interact with graphs using Apollo. If youâ€™ve already installed Rover, you can skip this section.

### MacOS/Linux
```
curl -sSL https://rover.apollo.dev/nix/latest | sh
```

### Windows
```
iwr 'https://rover.apollo.dev/win/latest' | iex
```

## Install and configure the recommended extensions

### For schema development

#### VS Code
ðŸ”— [Install Apollo's VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=apollographql.vscode-apollo)
ðŸ”— [GraphQL development in VS Code](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/schema-design/ide-support/vs-code)

#### JetBrains
ðŸ”— [Install Apollo's JetBrains plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20645-apollo-graphql)
ðŸ”— [Schema development in JetBrains IDEs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/schema-design/ide-support/jetbrains)

#### Vim/NeoVim

## Initialize a new project

rover init
```

ðŸ““ **Note:** If youâ€™re already logged into an existing Apollo organization by the time you run this command, the CLI will nudge you to go to Apollo Studio. From there, you can create a new personal API key to interact with Rover. If you donâ€™t have an account yet, visiting the link will prompt you to create one.
