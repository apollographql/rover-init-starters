## Introduction

👋 Welcome\!

This graph was created using `rover init`. 

`rover init` is designed to help you set up a new, federated GraphQL API using Apollo’s Rover CLI, [Apollo Connectors for REST](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/connectors), and your existing REST APIs.

This command:

* Creates a set of template files in your current directory
* Generates the credentials your GraphQL API will need to interact with Apollo’s GraphOS platform
* Provides a starter schema to help you design your GraphQL API
* Walks you through spinning up a local environment to test your API
