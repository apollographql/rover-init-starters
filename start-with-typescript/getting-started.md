# Overview

üëã Hi there!

Your new graph is set up with [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/schema-design/federated-schemas/federation). This means it‚Äôs built to grow, even if you‚Äôre starting with just one service. Right now, that service is defined in `products.graphql`, and you can treat it like a regular GraphQL API as you build it out.

Your service uses [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server) as its backend, a production-ready GraphQL server that connects your schema to any data source and handles all GraphQL execution, caching, and performance optimizations.

This project is also set up to use [Apollo Router](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing) as the entry point for all requests to your graph. It‚Äôs a great way to get features like tracing, metrics, and caching out of the box. It gives you a single place to configure settings for your graph, like traffic shaping, authorization, and more. For now, the router simply forwards requests to your service, but as your graph grows, it can pull data from multiple places and return one clear, consistent result.

## Components of your GraphQL service

Before diving in, it's helpful to understand the structure and purpose of some of the files included in this template. This will help you navigate the codebase more effectively.

### The schema (`products.graphql`)

The schema describes what data is available, how it‚Äôs structured, and how it can be requested or modified. It‚Äôs written using GraphQL‚Äôs Schema Definition Language (SDL), which lets you define the shape and capabilities of an API in a clear, type-safe way that is also backend-agnostic.

### Resolvers (`src/resolvers`)

A resolver function populates the data for a particular field in the schema. Resolvers are defined in a resolvers map that follows the hierarchy of the schema.

You can find the resolvers for this project in `src/resolvers`. Each file corresponds to a type in your schema.

### The server (`src/index.ts`)

The server is in charge of making sure requests are valid, finding the right data, and sending it back to the requester.


# Designing your graph

## IDE extensions for graph development

[Apollo‚Äôs IDE extensions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/ide-support) are designed to help you catch and correct any issues related to schema design as early as possible. Lean on their instant feedback and autocomplete capabilities to help you create the types, fields, arguments, and more.

## Working on your graph locally

After completing the `rover init` flow, run the command you see in your terminal under **Next steps** (it will start with your `APOLLO_KEY`). This allows you to work with Apollo Router locally, giving you a way to design and test your supergraph in a safe environment, without the need to deploy anything yet.

You‚Äôll get automatic [build checks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/platform/schema-management/checks#build-checks-1), so you can identify issues early and make sure your services work together. It‚Äôs a fast way to iterate with confidence before going live.

Once you run the command, the CLI will start watching your files for updates. Every time you make a change, Rover checks to see if the schema is valid. You can think of it as ‚Äúhot-reloading‚Äù for your GraphQL schema. [More details about the dev command](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/dev).

## The design process

The best way to get started with schema design is to check out the different [schema types](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/schema-design) that make up your graph. You can also go straight to Apollo‚Äôs schema design guides, starting with [Demand-Oriented Schema Design](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/schema-design/guides/demand-oriented-schema-design).

# Publishing changes to GraphOS Studio

Publishing your graph saves your schema to the GraphOS registry, allowing you to track its evolution and collaborate smoothly with your team when needed. GraphOS handles your first publish for you during `init` and creates an environment (or graph variant) called `current`, but any subsequent changes you make will require additional publishes.

Once you're happy with the state of your graph, replace the placeholder items in this command with your own and run it:

```
rover subgraph publish your-graph-id@current \ # Replace this with your APOLLO_GRAPH_REF value
  --schema "./products.graphql" \
  --name products \
  --routing-url "https://my-running-subgraph.com/api" # Replace this with your service URL
```

**üìì Note:** The `rover subgraph publish` command usually includes a `--routing-url` flag, which is only required during your first publish or any time you want to change your routing URL. Otherwise, this flag can be left out. [Review other command options](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/subgraphs#publishing-a-subgraph-schema-to-graphos).

# Deployment

For your supergraph to work, two things must be true:

**The Apollo Router must be deployed.** The Router is what makes your graph live. It connects to GraphOS to fetch your published schema and serves a single GraphQL endpoint for your clients. It handles the work of calling the right subgraphs and combining their results behind the scenes.

**Each service needs to be reachable by the router.** Your service‚Äôs backend (in this case, Apollo Server) also needs to be deployed to expose a URL that the router can call.

If you already know how to deploy and host the router, excellent! If you‚Äôd like some guidance for this step, [head over to Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/) to set your endpoint and review deployment options.

For instructions on how to deploy Apollo Server (using AWS Lambda or Heroku), [visit the Apollo Server docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/deployment/lambda).

# Security

For a more secure and reliable API, Apollo recommends updating your CORS policy and introspection settings for production or any published/publicly accessible environments. You can do so by:

- Specifying which origins, HTTP methods, and headers are allowed to interact with your API
- Turning off GraphQL introspection to limit the exposure of your API schema

Making these updates helps safeguard your API against common vulnerabilities and unauthorized access. To learn more, check out [Apollo‚Äôs documentation on Graph Security](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/platform/security/overview).
