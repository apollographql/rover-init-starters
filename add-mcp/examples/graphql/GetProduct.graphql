# üîç Fetch specific product details
#
# Works with start-with-typescript template
# (REST template doesn't have single product query)
#
# What your AI assistant can do with this:
# - "Show me details for product ID 12345"
# - "Get information about this specific product" 
# - "What are the details for product abc123?"
# - "Tell me about this product"
#
# Note: This query requires the TypeScript template which includes
# a product(id:) resolver. The REST template only has products (plural).

query GetProduct($productId: ID!) {
  product(id: $productId) {
    id              # Product unique identifier
    name            # Product title/name  
    description     # Product details and description
  }
