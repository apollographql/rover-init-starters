# Works with start-with-typescript template
# (REST template is read-only with @connect directive)

# What your AI assistant can do with this:
# - "Create a product called 'Wireless Headphones' with description 'High-quality audio'"
# - "Add a new product to the catalog" 
# - "Create a product for laptop with these details..."
# - "Add this item to our product inventory"
#
# Note: This mutation requires the TypeScript template which includes
# the createProduct resolver. The REST template is read-only.
